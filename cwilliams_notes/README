Generating LLVM IR for runtime environment
==========================================

1. Enter Docker container by running 
        ./docker-run.sh
    - Note: the code inside of ./runtime will be mounted inside the container
2. From inside container 
        cd /opt/runtime
        clang-3.8 -S -emit-llvm *.c
        llvm-link-3.8 -S -v -o runtime.ll *.ll
3. At this point you will have a single 'runtime.ll' file that contains the LLVM IR 
   representation the entire runtime environment, which should be useful for compiling
   subsequent Python programs
